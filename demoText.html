        <h1>THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS</h1>
        <a> Several planned features have not been implemented, including most notibly, when a change is made to an employees Schedule it applies over the whole thing
            instead of a set date. In the future schedule changes will have start and end dates so that old shifts will not be changed and future changes can be planned 
            months ahead of time. This program also currently lacks the ability to add single temporary shifts or trade shifts.
        </a>
        <br><br>
        <a> Other improvments including security and interface improvements are also on the docket and even have groundwork layed for them. Authentication has been disabled 
            in this test enviroment but partialy implemented already. Feedback is encouraged and there is a large todo list currently on my github repo found 
            <a href="https://github.com/BrandtNorwood/ScheduleForge">here</a>.

        <a> As I continue making updates to this you will continue to have access to this demo version. I have a copy of the datafile so don't worry about experimenting with 
            making changes and potentialy trashing this dataset. Delete who you want and make weird schedules and just let me know when it needs to be reset.
