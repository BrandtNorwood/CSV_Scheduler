## TODO
 
* Rework entire way schedlues are stored and parsed. 
  - Move to "Schedules" with "Shifts" that repeat every x amount of days from an origin date. This will allow significantly more flexability at the sacrifice of my sanity.
  - Gut the CSV parser
  - changes to schedule should only be applied after a date. You should be able to go back and view the way things were before

* CORS config

* Shift 'Groups'

* Temporary shift (reverse pto)

* Be able to generate an empty file from scratch

* More secure super user storage method

* Support Multiple shifts per day

* MASSIVE UI Overhaul

* Server automatic setup

* Multiple databases per server?
