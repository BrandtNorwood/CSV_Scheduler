## TODO

* Make new user selected after creation

* changes to schedule should only be applied after a date. You should be able to go back and view the way things were before
  - This could be done by moving to an array of start-end objects with start end dates. Allows to keep most of the same datatype and parser while adding substantial functionality

* CORS config

* Shift 'Groups'

* PTO requests displayed at bottom of schedule

* PTO overview that shows all pending PTO requests.
  - Do not display ones older then current system time

* Temporary shift (reverse pto)

* PTO Requests
  - Implement "All Day" bypass
  - Remove ones older then one week of current date when outputing

* Be able to generate an empty file from scratch

* More secure super user storage method

* Support Multiple shifts per day

* MASSIVE UI Overhaul

* Server automatic setup

* Multiple databases per server?
